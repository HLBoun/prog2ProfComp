requirements:
- Function that accepts a pointer to a C-string as an argument
- Function should display the string backwards.
- User inputs the string, then the string is passed to the function.



	Main concerns are that strings are technically arrays of chars.
Passing as a pointer should be easily done. 

	Function can be made with two strategies. Either take the pointer
and add to the mem-address to iterate, or add the string to a
vector/dynamically allocated array (but backwards.)
